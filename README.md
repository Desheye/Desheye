Hi my name is Desheye and i love to bring web designs to life for a great digital experience.
I'm currently in the Alx Software Engineering Programme, and guess what? theyy didnt lie when they said 'Do Hard Things'
I speak and i'm fluent in Yoruba, English, Pidgin-English, Python and Javascript.
I'm looking to collaborate on mini-projects to sharpen my skills and maybe reach out to a wider tech community, and possibly grow my tribe.

I'm always here <thefelainme@gmail.com> <aarealaafiaboyz@gmail.com> +234-8167-11-8379 @concieveXcreate on X
